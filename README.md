# PCOS-PCOD-Tracker-System

The PCOS/PCOD Symptom Tracker is a Java-based desktop application designed to support women in managing symptoms related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOD). It allows users to log daily symptoms, track menstrual cycles, receive reminders for medical check-ups, and export symptom reports to share with healthcare professionals.

This project bridges the gap between healthcare and technology, providing a practical and personal tool to empower women to better understand and manage their reproductive health.
